# OpenXcom From the Ashes [![Workflow Status][workflow-badge]][actions-url]

[workflow-badge]: https://github.com/OpenXcom/OpenXcom/workflows/ci/badge.svg
[actions-url]: https://github.com/OpenXcom/OpenXcom/actions

This is a fork of [OpenXcom project](https://openxcom.org) - an open-source clone of the popular "UFO: Enemy Unknown" ("X-COM:
UFO Defense" in the USA release) and "X-COM: Terror From the Deep" videogames
by Microprose, licensed under the GPL and written in C++ / SDL.

Current fork of the game engine inherits all features from OXC and OXCE ongoing development and 
provides several exclusive game mechanics. See [project's wiki](https://github.com/723Studio/OpenXcom_FTA/wiki) for more details.

## Installation

OpenXcom requires a vanilla copy of the X-COM resources -- from either or both
of the original games.  If you own the games on Steam, the Windows installer
will automatically detect it and copy the resources over for you.

If you want to copy things over manually, you can find the Steam game folders
at:

    UFO: "Steam\SteamApps\common\XCom UFO Defense\XCOM"
    TFTD: "Steam\SteamApps\common\X-COM Terror from the Deep\TFD"

Do not use modded versions (e.g. with XcomUtil) as they may cause bugs and
crashes.  Copy the UFO subfolders to the UFO subdirectory in OpenXcom's data
or user folder and/or the TFTD subfolders to the TFTD subdirectory in OpenXcom's
data or user folder (see below for folder locations).

## Mods

Current engine version is designed to be used together with [X-COM: From the Ashes
mod](https://github.com/723Studio/X-Com-From-the-Ashes). Still, currently it is fully compatible 
with all OXC an OXCE mods, and does not have any game breaking changes. If you
face any bug with mod, please, let us know with created issue in this repository.
All major changes in this code, compared to OpenXcom or OpenXcom Extended are
locked behind `ftaGame` property (see [project's wiki](https://github.com/723Studio/OpenXcom_FTA/wiki) for more info.)

## Directory Locations

OpenXcom has three directory locations that it searches for user and game files:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Folder Type</th>
    <th>Folder Contents</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>user</td>
    <td>mods, savegames, screenshots</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>config</td>
    <td>game configuration</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>UFO and TFTD data files, standard mods, common resources</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each of these default to different paths on different operating systems (shown
below).  For the user and config directories, OpenXcom will search a list of
directories and use the first one that already exists.  If none exist, it will
create a directory and use that.  When searching for files in the data
directory, OpenXcom will search through all of the named directories, so some
files can be installed in one directory and others in another.  This gives
you some flexibility in case you can't copy UFO or TFTD resource files to some
system locations.  You can also specify your own path for each of these by
passing a commandline argument when running OpenXcom.  For example:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/bin/OpenXcom/usr/share/openxcom"

or, if you have a fully self-contained installation:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/games/openxcom/data" -user "$HOME/games/openxcom/user" -config "$HOME/games/openxcom/config"

## Development

OpenXcom requires the following developer libraries:

- [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org) (libsdl1.2)
- [SDL\_mixer](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) (libsdl-mixer1.2)
- [SDL\_gfx](http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/) (libsdl-gfx1.2), version 2.0.22 or later
- [SDL\_image](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) (libsdl-image1.2)
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp), version 0.5.3 or later

The source code includes files for the following build tools:

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 or newer
- Xcode
- Make (see Makefile.simple)
- CMake

It's also been tested on a variety of other tools on Windows/Mac/Linux. More
detailed compiling instructions are available at the
[wiki](https://ufopaedia.org/index.php/Compiling_(OpenXcom)), along with
pre-compiled dependency packages.
